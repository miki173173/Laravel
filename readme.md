This application is a Vue.js and Laravel based application which allows users to search for Youtube videos using the Youtube Search API.

The primary intention of this code base is to support the video tutorial series that I have created for my [Youtube channel](http://bit.ly/2EtBHne).

Right now, I have used the Youtube API to display the data and also user Javascript library Isotope to create the grid structure. 

Will be adding more features to this application. Stay tuned for more updates.

## Features
**Dashboard** - Your dashboard will give you a listing of videos based on your last search result which is stored in your local storage, or it will fall back to a hard coded search result.

**View video** - You can click and go inside a video detail page to see the description, play the video and do a few more things.

**Comments** - You can add a comment for individual videos.

**Playlists** - You have an option to create your own playlists and add videos to individual playlists.
